# Training & Collaborative Resources for Ongoing Projects

This repo consolidates various resource lists for more and less related projects.


## Collaboration

I use the following resources to coordinate work with colleagues:

* [Google Drive](drive.google.com/): Each project has a dedicate Google Doc with meeting agendas and near-term tasks or goals. We also compile tables, draft manuscripts and slideshows, and prepare other materials in Docs, Sheets, or other formats. No sensitive or unpublished content may be posted here.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): Zotero is a reference manager with a web interface and a downloadable app. It facilitates shared annotations of PDFs and BibTeX exports of reference lists. Each project maintains its own Zotero Group. Each member must have a Zotero account.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/): All projects involve collaborative version control. For simplicity, i use this one service for all projects. Each member must have a GitHub account.
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): Higher-speed collaborative LaTeX documents may be prepared here. Each collaborator will need an account.
